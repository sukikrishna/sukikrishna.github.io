            <div class="body-portion" style="font-family: PTSans">
                Our project aims to transform the way we spend, track, and budget money online. Throughout this
                project, we will be focusing on the largest online retailer in the US - Amazon. As of June 2022, Amazon
                accounted for 37.8% of the U.S e-commerce market, and ships approximately 1.6 million packages daily.
                Products on this site range from every-day living supplies to high end technology and fashion. In the
                beginning stages of this project, we aim to uncover the reliance that users have on Amazon, their
                motivations, and pain points users experience regarding consumption via this site. We hope to propose
                design ideas that curb exuberant consumption and spending, and encourage budgeting, money tracking, and
                conscious consumption (skills that are necessary in becoming financially independent adults).</br>
                <br>
                To do so, we will be targeting users of various lifestyles that utilize Amazon in various ways. Our user
                segments are as follows:</br>
                <br>
                <li>Parents</li>
                <li>New Graduates</li>
                <li>College Students</li>
                <br>
                Breaking down users in this manner will help us understand varying motivations and user journeys, and
                even help pinpoint which users would benefit the most from focusing on conscious consumption.
                Understanding differing experiences with Amazon will help us gain wider perspectives on user behavior
                and possible pain points that we can specifically address throughout this project. As mentioned before,
                the tasks we aim to focus on during this project are money budgeting, tracking, and research on the
                goods and services being bought.<br>
                <br>
                Our team hopes this project not only has the potential to reframe our relationship with spending and
                drive ethical and conscious consumption, but also impact individual financial literacy and awareness
                within this country. Globally, our world is suffering from industries like fast fashion that manipulate
                users into spending fast and spending a lot, and we hope to address this endemic by designing features
                that specifically combat these realities.<br>

            <div class="body-portion" style="font-family: PTSans"> We conducted user interviews to eight
                individuals,
                with at least one person from
                each segment/lifestyle category.
                This priliminary analysis was to perform a more accurate data analysis on the spending habits and
                analytics of what product categories these indivdiuals tend to buy most from. A link to the spreadsheet

                    <h4>Group 1: Quality of Time Spent on Amazon</h4>
                    <OL>
                        <li>When you use Amazon, are you mindful of the amount of time you are spending on the site?
                        </li>
                    </OL>
                    <h5>Key Insights</h5>
                    There were two observable key learnings in regards to <strong>quality of time spent</strong> on
                    Amazon. Either
                    users utilize Amazon exactly when they need it and spend no more than 20-30 minutes on the site, or
                    they are users who tend to browse through the site. Browsing seemed to be a crucial task that was a
                    part of many user journeys. <strong>It is noticed that it’s easy to get lost while browsing</strong>
                    where
                    oftentimes, users will go to an online site with a specific goal, but get lost due to the noise and
                    product competition within the site.
                    <br>


                    <h4>Group 2: Spending Habits on Amazon</h4>
                    <OL>
                        <li>Do you find yourself overspending on Amazon? Why do you think that is?</li>
                        <li>Are there specific seasons during the year you find yourself overspending on Amazon?</li>
                        <li>How easy does Amazon make it to spend your money?</li>
                        <li>Do you believe you are more likely to overspend when shopping in-person, or online? Why do
                            you
                            think so?</li>
                    </OL>
                    <h5>Key Insights</h5>
                    The key learnings in regards to spending habits and budgeting of our interviewees is that
                    typically, users who are more mindful and intentional about their time spent on Amazon also tend to
                    spend less on the site, and vice versa. Amazon leverages the variety of products they have on their
                    site to promote upselling and product stacking, which leads to overspending.
                    <br>
                    Generally, holidays, birthdays, and the like (seasons of giving) appear to be periods in which users
                    admit to overspending, regardless of user segment. Browsing seems to be a critical task during these
                    seasons - most users claim to be less intentional about their time spent browsing because they turn
                    to Amazon to inspire gift-giving ideas.
                    <br>
                    Another key learning is that most users tend to overspend when shopping online than in-person. This
                    can be motivated by the pandemic, in which more people converted to being an online shopper. With
                    the user interface, the design makes it easy and efficient to filter through products (by rating or
                    price) and most of a user’s personal credit information is saved, so it is more casual to buy more
                    items and not keep track of spending. Most subjects claimed that spending online leads to a
                    detachment between the user and money, making it more likely to overspend. With recommendations
                    provided on Amazon that tend to prompt users to look at more expensive products, rather than better
                    deals/value, Amazon makes it incredibly easy to motivate users to buy more items. Amazon also has a
                    very straightforward system to make it easy for users to make purchases by allowing multiple payment
                    options, and with one swipe on a phone/desktop interface it leads to a direct purchase. The option
                    to purchase is at every single step of the user journey, which further adds to the ease and
                    convenience factor of online shopping.
                    <br>
                    Product competition and continuous recommendations prompt users to be more inclined to make a
                    purchase by promoting exposure of various products to users. One finding from the user research is
                    that users who spend more time on Amazon tend to use the wishlist feature more, which promotes
                    further spending because a lack of spending at one point can still point to a future purchase.
                    Overall, users who spent more time on Amazon were more likely to say that they overspent online, and
                    vice versa.
                    <br>

                    <h4>Group 3: Product Categories on Amazon</h4>
                    <OL>
                        <li>Do you find yourself shopping more for wants or needs on Amazon? Why do you think that is?
                        </li>
                        <li>What kinds of product categories do you think you buy most of off of Amazon. Are there any
                            product categories you usually stray away from?</li>
                    </OL>
                    <h5>Key Insights</h5>
                    Through asking questions on product categories we found that users focused more on needs and
                    daily supplies rather than wants on a regular basis. However during holiday/gift giving seasons,
                    Amazon is used to drive inspiration of gifts and presents, but is often used more for inspiration
                    and idea building rather than actual purchase. Users tend to stay away from clothing as the quality
                    is not guaranteed from small brands or unknown retailers. They were more driven to buy specific
                    items, especially electronics, during off season/promotion season as the quality is guaranteed from
                    name brands. Finally, we found that users who spend more time on amazon are more likely to shop for
                    wants and vice versa
                    <br>

                    <h4>Group 4: Sentiment on Money Management Tools</h4>
                    <OL>
                        <li>Do you use any tools to manage your budget? If so what is your favorite feature?</li>
                        <li>Would a integrated budget tool in a online shopping website make you want to use their
                            service
                            more often?</li>
                        <li>Would you use a money tracking or budgeting tool on Amazon? </li>
                        <li>If you could wave a magic wand and develop a money tracking tool on Amazon, what information
                            would you like to see through it?</li>
                    </OL>
                    <h5>Key Insights</h5>
                    For the questions regarding how users manage their budget, most users declared that they do not
                    currently utilize money management tools. Rather, if they do, it is largely through their bank or
                    individual Excel sheets. One user in particular stated, “I do not like to set a budget because it
                    psychologically primes me to actually spend the budget that I set. Instead, I try to keep track of
                    how often I spend and try to spend a little less than the month before,” which brings up an
                    interesting point as users generally claimed they didn’t realize how much they don’t track their
                    Amazon spending until they were asked in the interview.
                    <br>
                    Users who did not spend much time on Amazon claimed that having a money tracking tool on Amazon
                    would not affect their time spent on Amazon. However, frequent Amazon users claimed that having a
                    tool would actually increase their time spent on the app as they would feel more intentional and
                    less guilty about the time they spend browsing.
                    <br>
                    If a money tracking tool existed, users want to make sure that tool was customizable according to
                    their own needs - they do not want Amazon telling them how to spend. Those who claim they tend to
                    overspend online are more inclined to have positive sentiment and demand for a money tracking tool
                    as they tend to “splurge” more often. Users want to be able to set and customize a budget if a tool
                    were to exist. Multiple subjects wanted a block on spending once that budget was reached.
                    Specifically, users want to see how much they are saving each month. Typically, users are more
                    motivated by positive reinforcement when it comes to restricting spending. Users want to see
                    responsive, intelligent recommendations that are not simply geared towards more expensive products,
                    but rather tailored to their budget and spending needs. Dynamic recommendations were also desired,
                    for instance incorporating a filtering system that allows users to better personalize their
                    management system according to financial status, income, expenditures, etc.
                    <br>
                    Those who said they would use the money management tool also specifically stated they would use
                    Amazon even more if the service was available which is significant because smart spending can mean
                    more spending in the long run.

                <div class="body-portion">The main change that we made here from the before and after screens was

                    The old design does not do a good job of promoting this because people would most likely scroll
                    through
                    it
                    quickly and not even read the text. The newer design follows the UI of LinkedIn’s other promoted
                    posts
                    and
                    gives people more options to improve their network including suggesting more mentors and people with
                    similar
                    experiences. The last button also would direct people to a “Manage network” setting.</div>

                    #opentomentor
                    banner on the profile pictures. We made the circle frame on Illustrator and transferred it to Figma
                    as a
                    way
                    for people to advertise themselves as mentors. These frames already exist for people who are open to
                    work
                    and hiring, so we wanted to add another component to these frames. The frames were helpful for some
                    of
                    our
                    participants in the user testing because they felt more encouraged to connect to potential mentors.
                    However, one participant said that they were desensitized to these frames and thought that it wasn’t
